# odin-landing-page

In this odin project I will be creating an entire web page from a design provided for me.

The design provided comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors used.

I will be getting my project as close as I can to the design, but it does not have to be a pixel-perfect match. The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest. It doesnâ€™t matter if I use margin: 24px when the design actually has margin: 48px.
